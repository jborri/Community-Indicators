# Community Indicators
 Quantitative and qualitative analyses of what affects a sense of community using Python/Jupyter Notebook.
 Each Analysis is accompanied by visualizations in the respective language.

# Introduction: What is Community?
In the Age of the Internet, social groups are often formed around shared hobbies or interests, ranging from videogames, to music, to particular websites you enjoy browsing. However, prior to digital connectivity that transcends distance, bonds formed with others was often limited to geographic location and proximity to each another. Every day you would spend time interacting with the same people and begin to form a sense of kinship or community. To me, community is a shared, lived experience. Individuals gather and share ideas, stories, advice and help one another when in need.
Even though we’ve all experienced this, whether it be digitally or physically, I wondered, “What affects the quality of a community?” In this report, we will be discussing select indicators from various data sources to help elucidate what exactly does influence the quality of a community. The following reports will be used in this report:<br>
“Social Progress Index”
from the Social Progress Imperative<br>
“Human Development Index” from the United Nations<br>
“World Happiness Index”
from the Sustainable Development Solutions Network<br>
“Global Multidimensional Poverty Index”
from the Oxford Poverty & Human Development Initiative<br>

Each one of these reports is a carefully curated collect of data consisting of a wide scope of variables measuring different aspects of global social indicators. Thanks for the effort of these organizations, we will be able to analytically examine, using predictive and best fit models, what indicators influence communities. But first, it is imperative to analyze who has collected this data and why.

# Critical Reflection: Applying the Seven Principles of Data Feminism to Data
Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein, in their book, Data Feminism, discuss seven strategies, or principles, for data scientists to keep in mind when handling data through the lens of feminism. In this report, we will follow their protocol and apply their seven concepts of:
1.) Examining Power
2.) Challenging Power
3.) Elevating Emotion/Embodiment 4.) Rethinking Binaries and Hierarchies 5.) Embracing Pluralism
6.) Considering Context
7.) Making Labor Visible<br><br>

# Examining Power
Examining power deals with taking a look at how power operates in the world. They define the term, power, as a way “to describe the current configuration of structural privilege and structural oppression, in which some groups experience unearned advantages—because various systems have been designed by people like them and work for people them—and other groups experience systematic disadvantages—because those same systems were not designed by them or with people like them in mind.” If we apply this concept of power to the organizations that have collected our data, the Matrix of Domination becomes apparent. Each one of these organizations is heavily funded by private companies like Gallop or are simply a branch of a much larger corporation that deals with data collection. Global social indicators are influential enough to determine which countries receive more funding or whether or not they are classified as “3rd World Countries”. These classifications can be considerably damaging to people alive today and creates an imbalance of power as is described in Data Feminism.

# Challenging Power
In order to challenge this Matrix of Domination, and work towards justice, we must acknowledge the challenges presented. Many countries within these data sets do not have values for certain indicators. These missing values can negatively affect those particular countries. Maybe they will be seen as “uncooperative and secretive” or not developed enough to have the luxury to collect said data. One way to challenge this imbalance, is to encourage citizens to compile their own data, effectively creating a baseline and give these global corporations something to compare to. But instead of attempting to hold these mega-corporations accountable, but rather to seek co-liberation, where there is mutual benefit to everyone involved—equalizing the imbalance of power.

# Elevating Emotion/Embodiment
When analyzing data pertaining to global social indicators, it is easy to forget that there are real human beings behind these stats and numbers. When we acknowledge this, we bring to the forefront that knowledge and information exists outside of numbers. All the mentioned corporations present their collected data in “simple and clean” spreadsheets, effectively reducing the humanity to nothing but numbers. If they were to present this information through means of other visualization that elicit an emotional response, not only would it engage more people, bringing awareness to the data and the people, but it could also present knowledge of history and culture of these countries, further increasing the magnitude of awareness of things like gender inequality or working conditions or rural infrastructure; all things communities need to thrive.

# Rethinking Binaries and Hierarchies
When looking over the datasets, most of the data is divided into male and female or above and below the poverty level. This type of data collect is damaging to communities that exist outside of this dichotomy. There is no mention of non-binary, trans, or other gendered folks that exist outside or in between of male and female. There is also very little mention of queer folks, and when they are mentioned, it’s simply labeled as “homosexual” and very often coupled with terms like tolerance or acceptance. Through the lens of data feminism and bringing awareness to these binaries can make visible the communities that exist on the “fringes”. And while sometimes visibility can put these communities in greater danger, it is still important to consider that they exist and can be conferred to when concerns and questions arise.
# Embracing Pluralism
This principle from Data Feminism explores the idea by engaging with local, and indigenous communities, we can gain more complete dataset than the one that would exist without engaging. As mentioned previously, there is experiential knowledge that exists outside of the number. By working with communities, we can gain a better understanding of what should and shouldn’t be collected, how to go about collecting it, all while increasing efficiency and accuracy of the data.
# Considering Context
Considering context shines light on the myth that data is “neutral and objective”. Behind the data collected by these companies, are communities that are constantly evolving and growing. Any time “Raw Data” is collected, there is an inherent bias created. This bias needs to be acknowledged to if we are to effectively introduce cultural context and nuances that exist in these countries and communities.

# Making Labor Visible
The final principle discussed is used to make labor visible. In all the datasets, there is no mention of the individual data scientists that have collected the data. This hard work should be recognized and valued. These people have dedicated their time and skills, without their efforts the data we will be using would not exist. By including names of the people behind the data, we reduce their exploitation and bring alive the entire lifecycle of the projects, which are almost always overlooked. By Making labor visible, we increase its value and recognition of not only the data, but the people behind it.
