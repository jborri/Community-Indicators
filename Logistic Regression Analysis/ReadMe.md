A Logistic Regression Analysis will allow us to estimate whether or not these indicators are able predict what is considered a “strong sense of community” (Our dependent variable) and what isn’t. We will be dividing the indicators into the categories, Health, Economic/Poverty, Governmental, and Happiness/Communal, to increase the number of indicators to study, but to also see which one has a greater impact.

The Threshold for the Social Support Binary used was 0.73971. Any country with a value lower than this would be assigned as having a “weaker” sense of community. The value used relates to the 25% of countries that fall below this value. I used 25% because with such a small standard deviation it would be harder to identify any difference at a higher threshold. A similar number of indicators was used for each categorical model.

Based off the prediction values, Happiness/Communal and Governmental had the highest values for predicting whether if a community had a high Social Support value, and also had the lowest values of predicting if they had a low social support value. These results coupled with the results of the marginal effects seem to align. Positive valued coefficients were much stronger than the negative valued ones. The Economic/Poverty model and the Health Model seemed to be the most reliable of the four for both predicting low and high social support values, and both had among the highest pseudo-R-squared values sitting around 30%.
